Corate aims to address challenges caused by information overload using a hybrid model of human + AI technology.
We start by crowdsourcing user selected highlights from web articles, and offer an easy way to search and revisit the saved highlights, organized by tags.
All saved highlights shall be displayed on the web articles to improve reading experience by visual and speed.
